Project Title: Stress Analysis of Iron Rod using ANSYS Software

Project Overview:

This project utilizes ANSYS software to conduct a comprehensive stress analysis of an iron rod. The analysis includes several critical steps:

Body Sizing: Optimizing the size and discretization of the rod geometry to ensure efficient and accurate simulations.

Decomposition: Dividing the rod into smaller elements or regions to simplify the analysis and allow for more precise control over the simulation.

Element Quality: Ensuring that the finite elements used in the analysis meet quality standards to maintain simulation accuracy.

Inflation: Applying inflation layers to mesh surfaces, enhancing the accuracy of boundary conditions and capturing gradients near the rod's surface.

Mesh Generation: Creating a mesh of finite elements to discretize the rod geometry, allowing for stress calculations at various points.

Static Analysis: Performing static analysis to determine the distribution of stresses within the rod under specified loads and boundary conditions.

Orthogonal & Skewness Checks: Verifying the mesh quality to minimize distortion and ensure reliable results.

Through this project, i aim to gain valuable insights into the stress distribution within the iron rod under different conditions. These insights can be crucial for optimizing the rod's design, material selection, and structural integrity.
